# TODO

## DX and Tooling

- refactor folder structure
- refactor index.ts, too large at 1200+ LOC
- improve code coverage


## Data Handling

- add checks for codes that are in the wrong heading
- support partial label matching e.g. "auctions" or "Auctions" for "Buying & Selling / Auctions & Dealerships"
- partial data scraping should save to bisac-data-partial.json instead of overwriting full file
- use another API other than Google Books
